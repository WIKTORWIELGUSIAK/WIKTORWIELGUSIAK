<h2>About me</h2>

I am
a novice programmer learning front-end on my own foralmost a year. At the beginning I was learning from the courses,but after about 3 months I started trying to create my ownprojects and this is how I learn until today. I am a conflict-freeperson and I learn quickly, I try not to make the same mistakestwice. I would like to continue my education as a frontenddeveloper, honoring my skills and knowledge.
